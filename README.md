# essential-aggregation-pipelines

This repo is showing the examples for the top 5 essential aggregation pipelines in MongoDB

## Examples are based on the MongoDB version 6.0

You can install MongoDB version 6.0 from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) and can also use the [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) to try out these examples.

## Sample Data

We will be using 2 sample data sets for this demo.

The first one is the [products](data/products.json) dataset and second one is the [orders](data/orders.json) sample dataset. Both of these datasets are available in the data folder.
